# Next-Word-Predictor
Building a recurrent neural network using Keras API

Using random texts and e-books found on google,
I used a tokenizer to process the texts to sequences.
Used the sequences to train a RNN model built with TensorFlow 2.0

It makes predictions based on previously typed sentences,
And while typing a sentence, the model makes a predictions based on the last word types.
